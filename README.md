# pytorch-language-driven-semantic-segmentation
My implementation of the original multimodal model for image semantic segmentation paper by Boyi Li et al.

# Plan 
- [ ] How to use CLIP to encode the text? 
- [ ] How to use the Dense Prediction Transformers to encode the image? 
- [ ] How to combine these two? 
- [ ] How to attach the bottleneck for the upsampling(?)
- [ ] What data set should I use?
