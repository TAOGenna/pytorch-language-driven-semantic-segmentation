# pytorch-language-driven-semantic-segmentation
My implementation of the original multimodal model for image semantic segmentation paper by Boyi Li et al.

# Plan
- [ ] Download data set:
    - [ ] COCO
    - [ ] ade20k
- [ ] resize images to what? see paper
- [ ] How to use the visualizer of Detectron2? [link](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/tree/22e04d1432363be727797a081e3e9d48981f5189)
- [ ] Implement the ViT wrapper for the DPT 
- [ ] Implement DPT (dense prediction transformer) and Test  
- [ ] play with the CLIP notebook to understand how it works 
- [ ] implement lseg model

Things I had to learn: 
- parsing to deal with several pretrained models
