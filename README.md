### Setup

### Dataset 

The dataset can be downloaded directly from `https://huggingface.co/datasets/richardz03/MSeg_COCO_ADE20K/tree/main`. We train our model only on the `ADE20K` dataset. 

The semantic labels for different datasets, including the one of ADE20K, can be found in `https://github.com/mseg-dataset/mseg-api/blob/master/mseg/class_remapping_files/MSeg_master.tsv`.
